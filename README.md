torre search
f I had more time, I would have improved my front end, applied better design since what I created is very basic. 
I would have added the favorites icon, made a more organized project, and connected it with the Torre API. I didn't do this because I always had permission errors. 
I requested access, but I haven't obtained it yet. I could have implemented a search filter that is not in another button but is part of the same container as the original searches. 
This project was a good challenge, and I really enjoyed working on it because, despite the difficulties I faced, I came up with solutions to try to meet the requirements
